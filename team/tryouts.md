The climbing team hosts tryouts for the team in the Fall and in the
Spring. In the Fall, all 30 of our rosters spots (15 male, 15 female)
are open to everybody trying out. In the Spring, we host limited
tryouts, only to fill the roster spots of teammates who are leaving to
go on a co-op, dialogue, or another reason.

Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/northeasternclimbing/)
to stay in the loop on tryouts!
