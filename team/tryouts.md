## General Info

The climbing team hosts tryouts for the team in the Fall and in the
Spring.

In the Fall, all 24 of our rosters spots (12 male, 12 female)
are open to everybody trying out. Climbers can choose to try out on
boulders or on ropes.

In the Spring, we host limited tryouts, only to fill the roster spots
of teammates who are leaving to go on a co-op, dialogue, or another
reason. These tryouts feature exclusively boulders.
