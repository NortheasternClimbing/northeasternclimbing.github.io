The Northeastern Climbing Team is the official competitive rock climbing team sanctioned through Northeastern University Club Sports.

Founded in 2014, the team found immediate success by winning the New England Regional Championships and placing second at the National Championships in Melbourne, Florida. Due to increased popularity, the team now maintains a roster of 30 total athletes: 15 male and 15 female.

The team currently trains at the Central Rock Climbing Gyms in Watertown and Cambridge, MA. Full tryouts are held at the beginning of the Fall semester and limited tryouts are held at the beginning of the Spring semester. Tryouts are open to all Northeastern students. The team competes through USA Climbing's Collegiate Series including local, regional, and national competitions.

In addition to competition-related endeavors, Northeastern Climbing Team members give back to the community through volunteer events and outreach. The team has partnered up with organizations such as OneSummit, Camp Casco, the Access Fund, and the HelpHOPELive Foundation to facilitate a positive impact in the community, and is continually pursuing ways to do so on the local and global scale.

Team members also excel in the academic realm, with awards in research and co-op placements at top employers such as Google, Apple, CERN, SpaceX, NASA, Draper, GE, Philips, Raytheon, and more.
