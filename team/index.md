The Northeastern Climbing Team is the official competitive rock climbing team sanctioned through Northeastern University Club Sports. Founded in 2014, the team found immediate success by winning the New England Regional Championships and placing second at the National Championships in Melbourne, Florida. Due to increased popularity, the team now maintains a roster of 30 total athletes: 15 male and 15 female.

The team currently trains at the Central Rock Climbing Gyms in Watertown and Cambridge, MA. Open tryouts are held at the beginning of the fall semester and are open to all undergraduate or graduate students of any major. The team competes in the New England Region of the USA Climbing Collegiate Series, as well as participating in other local and international competitions. Team members also organize outdoor climbing trips on weekends.

In addition to competition-related endeavors, Northeastern Climbing Team members give back to the community through volunteer events and outreach. The team has partnered up with organizations such as the Access Fund, the HelpHOPELive Foundation, and One Summit to facilitate a positive impact in the community, and is continually pursuing ways to do so on the local and global scale. Team members also excel in the academic realm, with awards in research and co-op placements at top employers such as Draper, Apple, CERN, GE, Philips, Raytheon, SpaceX, NASA, & Google.
