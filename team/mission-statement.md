The Northeastern University Club Climbing Team exists to provide resources to and empower climbers of all identities and backgrounds who are interested in the world of competition climbing. The team should strive each year to train and perform at the local, regional, national, and international levels, as well as to generate a positive impact on the stewardship of the greater New England climbing community.
