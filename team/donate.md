To continue to be competitive on a national and international level, the Northeastern Climbing Team relies on individual donations to help fund travel expenses. Costs of travel are high and our members are students who are already financing their own collegiate education. Please consider donating to our team. Any amount is more than welcome!

The Northeastern Rock Climbing Team is a 501(c)(3) tax deductible organization. All donations are considered charitable.

To donate:

1) Go to www.gonu.com/giveonline.

2) Select “Click here to select additional funds“.

3) Scroll down and check the box next to “Club – Rock Climbing“.

4) Select the red “CONTINUE” button.

5) Enter the amount you wish to donate (in USD).

6) Enter your donor information, including matching employer donations (if applicable).

7) Select the red “CONTINUE TO PAYMENT” button.


Thank you for your support and go Huskies!
