As a team in a cis and white-dominated sport, the Northeastern Climbing Team prioritizes diversity 
and inclusion. We stand by the LGBTQIA+ Black Lives Matter movement. We support those on the 
frontlines protesting and demanding the justice that is long overdue.

We recognize that the outdoor industry is not always outwardly inclusive, and The Northeastern
Climbing Team wants to listen and learn about how—as a team and as a sport—we can work towards
anti-racism, homophobia, etc. not just right now, but forever. We wish to cultivate an environment 
in which anyone who wants to climb can— regardless of their identity or background. We encourage our
teammates, competitors, climbing gyms and institutions to join us in recognizing and dismantling
the accessibility boundaries that are an incredibly exclusive part of our sport.

Our efforts to address this privelege and lack of diversity include:
* Partnering with local organizations that support youth accessibility to climbing in the greater
Boston Area.
* Incorporating anti-racism training into our orientation
* Facilitating these discussions continually going forward and listening to BIPOC within our
industry.

We also recognize that many of our beloved outdoor climbing areas exist on lands stolen from Indigenous
people. We must appreciate and respect these places, and make the effort to cultivate an
understanding of climbing, as well as the Indigenous perspective. This includes educating the team,
dedicating time and resources to organizations supporting such communities, and leaving land without
a trace, only love.

We are committed to continuing this conversation and learning all that we can. There is still a lot 
to be done. And, as a team, we promise to never remain stagnant, but continuously work towards progress.
We have compiled a [list of resources](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1D0LZb6QtCSVVTO1zKRNr70wFOmDM6--qvyrvA2a1Hyc/mobilebasic)
specifically aimed at amplifying the voices of BIPOC athletes in the outdoor industry.

We hope you feel empowered enough to provide feedback on how we can be
more supportive, open, and accountable. Reach out to us with any thoughts, concerns, or questions.
