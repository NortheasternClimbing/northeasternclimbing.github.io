title: Northeastern Climbing Team’s Open Letter to Black Communities

We are deeply saddened by the wrongful deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery,
Tony McDade, and countless other Black Americans who have died at the hands of law enforcement.
The Northeastern Climbing Team stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in
condemning the racist and unjust systems in this country. We support those on the frontlines
protesting and demanding the justice that is long overdue by holding those responsible for the
murders of Black people accountable and dismantling systems of oppression.

We sincerely apologize for our silence until now. We vow to commit ourselves and call upon the
deeply whitewashed outdoor industry to do the work required to dismantle these oppressive systems.
We recognize that Black people in America can’t even jog without the fear of death, so it’s unfair
of us to expect them to feel safe while climbing in spaces that largely exclude BIPOC. The Northeastern
Climbing Team wants to listen and learn about how—as a team and as a sport—we can work towards
anti-racism, not just right now, but forever. And this process starts with our team. Due to the
lack of diversity and inclusion in the climbing community, we will dramatically improve our efforts
to cultivate an environment in which anyone who wants to climb can— regardless of their identity or
background. We encourage our teammates, competitors, climbing gyms and institutions to join us in
first recognizing, and then, dismantling, the accessibility boundaries that are an incredibly
exclusive part of our sport.

In order to address the privilege within rock climbing, the Northeastern Climbing Team will start
by:
* Budgeting resources towards climbing gym day passes and climbing gear to distribute to our local
community.
* Partnering with local organizations that support youth accessibility to climbing in the greater
Boston Area, which will be decided upon in the coming weeks.
* Collaborating with our student community and our local gyms to fight for equity and access to
rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors.
* Incorporating anti-racism training into our orientation by establishing a social equity &
outreach position within the eboard and educating the team on the history of climbing.
* Facilitating these discussions continually going forward and listening to BIPOC within our
industry.

Finally, we find it necessary to also acknowledge the origins of climbing from a colonialist
perspective. We, as climbers, do not exist to conquer—especially when it is not ours to take. We
recognize that many of our beloved outdoor climbing areas exist on lands stolen from Indigenous
people. We must appreciate and respect these places, and make the effort to cultivate an
understanding of climbing, as well as the Indigenous perspective. This includes educating the team,
dedicating time and resources to organizations supporting such communities, and leaving land without
a trace, only love.

We will admit: as a club, we are behind. However, we are committed to continuing this conversation
and learning all that we can. There is still a lot to be done. And, as a team, we promise to never
remain stagnant, but continuously work towards progress.  We have compiled a [list of resources](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1D0LZb6QtCSVVTO1zKRNr70wFOmDM6--qvyrvA2a1Hyc/mobilebasic)
specifically aimed at amplifying the voices of BIPOC athletes in the outdoor industry
and will continue to update it and it will live as a live document, changing as
we educate ourselves further. We hope you feel empowered enough to provide feedback on how we can be
more supportive, open, and accountable. Reach out to us with any thoughts, concerns, or questions.
