Northeastern Recreational Climbing (NRC) is an inclusive student organization dedicated to the growth of the climbing community on campus at the recreational level. It is open to all students regardless of grade, gender, skill level, or experience.

The club won't be hosting any official climbing sessions this semester, but we still encourage our members to take advantage of our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nurecclimbing/shared_invite/enQtMjk1MDgxNzE5MjgzLTU1ZGIzZDIyZDM2NTY1YmJmZjQ4NTU3ZWM1NTdjNGVmNmRjN2EzNGY2YjhmODUxMTZhOTJhMjU1NGQ1MjY3ZjM) to get to know the other climbers in the Northeastern community. With that said, we would like to ask our members to follow Covid-19 safety guidelines (like wearing a mask, social-distancing, and avoiding large groups) and to recognize that we have to do our part to not spread the pandemic further.

Although we won't be climbing as a club this semester, we still have plenty of things to offer! We'll still be doing virtual movie nights and offering technique and workout lessons through our Youtube channel: [Northeastern Recreational Climbing Club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChBnlZ2JB83uiv6PnR765Xw/featured). We'll also be offering raffles for our members who join our monthly virtual meetings. We invite all of our members to send in climbing related pictures and/or videos of their favorite sends and bloopers for a chance to be featured on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nurecclimbing/) and to win a prize. For more information on both of those opportunities, check our [Send of The Week and Photo challenge page](https://northeasternclimbing.github.io/nrc/challenges/). Last but not least, we're rolling out our gear rental program this semester! Check out the [Looking to Rent Gear?](https://northeasternclimbing.github.io/nrc/gear_rental/) page for more details.
