Northeastern Recreational Climbing (NRC) is an inclusive student organization dedicated to the growth of the climbing community on campus at the recreational level. It is open to all students regardless of grade, gender, skill level, or experience.

The club will have our first official meeting on Monday January 24, 2022 6-7 PM @ 106 West Village G 

We encourage all of our memebers to take advantage of our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nurecclimbing/shared_invite/enQtMjk1MDgxNzE5MjgzLTU1ZGIzZDIyZDM2NTY1YmJmZjQ4NTU3ZWM1NTdjNGVmNmRjN2EzNGY2YjhmODUxMTZhOTJhMjU1NGQ1MjY3ZjM) to get to know the other climbers in the Northeastern community. In terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, the club is following the rules and guidelines set forth by the University, the city of Boston, and all the climbing gyms.

 We invite all of our members to send in climbing related pictures and/or videos of their favorite sends and bloopers for a chance to be featured on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nurecclimbing/) and to win a prize. For more information on both of those opportunities, check our [Send of The Week and Photo challenge page](https://northeasternclimbing.github.io/nrc/challenges/). Last but not least, we're rolling out our gear rental program this semester! Check out the [Looking to Rent Gear?](https://northeasternclimbing.github.io/nrc/gear_rental/) page for more details.
