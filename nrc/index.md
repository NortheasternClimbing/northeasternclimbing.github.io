## About

Northeastern Recreational Climbing (NRC) is an inclusive student organization dedicated to the growth of the climbing community on campus at the recreational level. It is open to all students regardless of grade, gender, skill level, or experience.

The club meets on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at Ruggles Station at 6:30pm, right near the pillar across from the Charlie Ticket station. We then take the T over to Rock Spot Climbing Gym to climb from 7pm onwards (feel free to bike there if you want!). NRC also hosts movie nights on campus once per month!


## Want to Join?

You don’t have to be a gym member or a club member to climb with us, just meet us at Ruggles on any of our meeting days and there will surely be someone to guest-pass you into the gym to climb for the day (a day pass is normally ~$20, but with a guest pass it is $10, plus $4 if you need to rent gear/shoes). However, this should really only be used to dip your feet into climbing at Rock Spot, since Rock Spot members only get two guest-passes a month and if you’re going to be climbing regularly it’s worth it to get a membership with the club and at Rock Spot.

So what are the benefits of paying the $10 club dues to join NRC?

$10 off the monthly membership at Rock Spot for the next year (Student memberships are usually $54/month, club members’ are $44/month. If you need to rent gear/shoes, it is an additional $10/month for either plan).

If you’re interested in joining NRC, you can find our treasurer, Elissa, in the Shillman lobby on Monday nights from 6:00pm-6:30pm (look for a girl with a laptop and a cash box). If you have questions, check the FAQ below. If you don’t see your question, send us an email at nurecclimbing@gmail.com. Don’t forget to join our Facebook group here, and follow the club on Instagram and Twitter (@nurecclimbing).

We look forward to climbing with you soon!

## FAQ

Q: Is it too late to join?

A: It’s never too late!

Q: Do I need to know anything about climbing to join?

A: Nope! Come along, and feel free to ask us anything (especially if this is your first time). We love getting new people psyched on climbing.

Q: Do I have to climb on every meeting day?

A: Technically, you don’t have to climb at all if you don’t feel like it (but where’s the fun in that?). Come to whatever days you can make and we’ll be glad to see you there!

Q: What about the technique/workout classes? Do I have to do those?

A: The weekly classes we offer are optional. However if you’re new to climbing, we highly recommend you use them to get a sense of good climbing technique, and we occasionally make brief club announcements at them as well.

Q: I can’t make Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays, but I want to climb. Should I still sign up?

A: Since a membership with us gets you the discount at Rock Spot, it can still be worth it to join. There’s no guarantee that you’ll see fellow NRC members climbing on alternative days, but don’t be afraid to ask in the Facebook group if anyone wants to take a trips on the days that you can make it, even if we aren’t meeting. You can climb whenever you want, really. When, and if it is worth it, is up to you.

Q: What’s the best way to receive updates about the club?

A: Requesting to join our email list is a surefire way to get all the most important and pertinent info about upcoming events and club affairs. However, our Facebook group (linked above) can be a hub of NRC and general climbing info like local competitions or member outings.

Q: What’s this about movie nights?

Every month, we will be hosting some climbing movie at the on-campus AfterHours venue. In the past, we’ve done movies like Valley Uprising and Reel Rock. If you want to attend one of these nights, we’ll be sending out emails and putting up fliers with information when the next one is coming up. And yes, there will be food.

Q: Does the club ever climb outside?

A: As a club, we do not. However, some members occasionally take trips on weekends to nearby parks like Lincoln Woods, Farley Ledges, Rumney, Pawtuckaway, and possibly others. If you want to get in on some of these outdoor trips, the safest bet is to join the Facebook group and watch for members posting invitations, as space is generally limited.

Q: What do I need to climb at Rock Spot?

A: All the gear that you would need can be rented, or you can bring your own. If you paid for gear rental, you have access to shoes, chalk, and a harness. Top-roping requires all three, whereas bouldering just needs the shoes and chalk. If you’ve never climbed there before, you also need to fill out their online waiver either prior to going or when you get there.

Q: What types of climbing does Rock Spot have?

A: Rock Spot is primarily a bouldering gym, meaning the majority of the gym has shorter climbs in which the climber is not roped in, and if you fall you land on thick padding. There is top-roping with both manual and auto belay as well, however not nearly as much.

Q: I’m a graduate student/part-time undergraduate student/College of Professional Studies student, can I still join?

A: Yup! You can become an associate member which gets you all the same benefits as a regular member.

Q: I don’t go to Northeastern but I still want to climb with you guys. Do I have any options?

A: You can join using the associate member system (see previous question), but keep in mind you won’t be able to join the Facebook group (since it requires a husky email verification).
