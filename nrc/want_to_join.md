You don’t have to be a gym member or a club member to climb with us, if you just want to give climbing a shot or can't climb regularly, come checkout our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nurecclimbing/shared_invite/enQtMjk1MDgxNzE5MjgzLTU1ZGIzZDIyZDM2NTY1YmJmZjQ4NTU3ZWM1NTdjNGVmNmRjN2EzNGY2YjhmODUxMTZhOTJhMjU1NGQ1MjY3ZjM) community! You'll definitely be able to find someone with a spare Rockspot guest-pass (a discounted $10 day pass with gear included) willing to share it, just make sure you are observing the Northeastern health guidelines for COVID-19 safety (latest info [here](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/frequently-asked-questions/)).

However, if you're sure you want to grab a climbing gym membership, make sure you grab a membership to NRC as well; it's only $10 for the whole year! Now you may be wondering what the benefits of paying the $10 club dues to join NRC are:

1. Discounted membership rates at climbing gyms in the Boston Area. As a club, we primarily climb at [Rock Spot](http://southboston.rockspotclimbing.com/) where you would recieve $10 off the monthly membership for the duration of your membership with the club (Student memberships are usually $75/month, club members’ are $65/month. If you need to rent gear/shoes, it is an additional $10/month for either plan). If you want to get a membership at other climbing gyms, membership to NRC will also get you $10 off the monthly rate at [CRG Boston](https://centralrockgym.com/boston/) and a special rate at [MetroRock](https://www.metrorock.com/boston) that's almost $20 less than their student rate. 
2. Discounts on the [CollegeOutside](https://www.collegeoutside.com/) online store. They sell tons of outdoor gear for climbing and backpacking!
3. [Free gear rental!](https://northeasternclimbing.github.io/nrc/gear_rental/)
