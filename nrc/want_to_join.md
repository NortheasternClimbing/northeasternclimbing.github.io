You don’t have to be a gym member or a club member to climb with us, just meet us at Ruggles on any of our meeting days and there will surely be someone to guest-pass you into the gym to climb for the day (a day pass is normally ~$20, but with a guest pass it is $10, plus $4 if you need to rent gear/shoes). However, this should really only be used to dip your feet into climbing at Rock Spot, since Rock Spot members only get two guest-passes a month and if you’re going to be climbing regularly it’s worth it to get a membership with the club and at Rock Spot.

So what are the benefits of paying the $10 club dues to join NRC?

1. $10 off the monthly membership at [Rock Spot](http://southboston.rockspotclimbing.com/) for the next year (Student memberships are usually $59/month, club members’ are $49/month. If you need to rent gear/shoes, it is an additional $10/month for either plan).
2. Discounts on the [CollegeOutside](https://www.collegeoutside.com/) online store

If you’re interested in joining NRC, you can find our treasurer, Avery, in the Shillman lobby on Monday nights from 6:00pm-6:30pm (look for a girl with a cash box). If you have questions, check the FAQ below. If you don’t see your question, send us an email at nurecclimbing@gmail.com. Don’t forget to [join our Facebook group here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nurecclimbing/), and follow the club on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/nurecclimbing) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nurecclimbing) (@nurecclimbing).

We look forward to climbing with you soon!
