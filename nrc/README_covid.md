# Heyo,

To the poor sap now in charge of the website, this was written to explain the hack job I did in order to swap out our previous (pre-covid) pages with updated pages that reflected information pertinent to NRC operation during Covid-19 (2020 fall).

- Files with the extention `.old` are the original files.
- To swap between original pre-covid pages and covid pages, just rename the files by labeling the covid ones with a `.covid` or `.alt` and removing the `.old` extension from the original files.
- This may be a janky method overall because I have no clue about what I'm doing; I'm a firmware guy for god's sake.
- The one exception is that `contact.md.old` only differs from the current one by one thing. I removed Twitter from our newer contact page because we haven't used it, but in the event that someone looks through here and decides to revive it, I've left the `.old` file there as a record.

Love,

*Derrin*
