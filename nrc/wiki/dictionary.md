Word | Meaning
---- | --------
Beta | Information, generally used to describe/ask about the sequence, method, or solution of completing a climb (i.e. What's your beta on this problem?)
Send | The completion of a climb
Redpoint | To complete a climb fully from ground up
Flash | To complete a climb on your first attempt, possibly with advanced knowledge of the correct Beta
Onsight | To complete a climb on your first attempt having never seen the climb previously/having no Beta
Burn | Refers to one try, or attempt, on a climb (i.e. Good burn, give it a burn)
Project | Typically a difficult route/problem that takes many tries to both figure out and complete, possibly over multiple days
Bouldering | Climbing using the protection of crash pads
Sport Climbing | Climbing using the protection of a rope and periodically clipping to pre-installed bolts
Trad Climbing | Climbing using gear for protection, such as cams and nuts, in constrictions, cracks, or features in the wall
Chossy | Generally loose or sketchy climbing, typically involving loose rock or features
Sick | i.e. You know any sick lines in this area?
Line | i.e. You know any sick lines in this area?
Gamba Gamba Gamba | C'mon! You got this! We are all supporting you!
Ale | Gamba Gamba Gamba
Venga Venga | Ale Ale
Harness | Secures a person to a rope or an anchor point.
Locking Carabiner | Carabiners that have a locking mechanism for the gate to ensure they stay closed
Non-Locking Carabiner | Carabiners that do not have a locking gate
Rope | Used for top rope or lead climbing
Climbing Shoes | Specialized type of footwear designed for rock climbing. Typical climbing shoes have a close fit, little if any padding, and a smooth, sticky rubber sole with an extended rubber rand.
ATC (belay device) | Tubular or rectangular shaped belay device, cheapest and easiest to use/learn.
Gri Gri | Assisted-braking belay device from Petzl
Chalk Bag/Bucket | Holds chalk; bags are small and generally can be carried around your waist. Buckets are big, hold more chalk, and don't spill as often when you set them down.
Quickdraw | Allow the climbing rope to run freely through bolt anchors or other protection while leading. 2 Carabiners connected by a "dogbone", which is a sling that allows the carabiner attached to the bolt/protection to move freely while keeping the rope-side carabiner rigid. Quickdraws allow for wandering on routes and prevent rope-drag (being inhibited by the friction of the rope on your protection due to angles in the climbing line).
Alpine Draw | Basically quickdraws that use slings instead of a dogbone (so they don't keep one side rigid), allow you to "extend" gear/bolts to further reduce friction/rope drag
Bouldering Crash Pad | Large mat of foam used to protect falls while bouldering. These soften landings as well as flatten the landing zone to prevent rolled ankles, etc.
Webbing | Strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube of varying width and fibres, often used in place of rope.
Camming Device (Cam) | Active protection for trad climbing consisting of 3 or 4 cams that exert outward force in parallel cracks in order to hold falls
Nut (Stopper) | Passive protection for trad climbing
Cord | Thin (~5-7mm), static line. Can be tied into a loop to create cordelettes. Many general anchor uses.
Climbing Helmet | Protects your head, different from bike helmets as they offer more protection on TOP (falling rocks/things, hitting head while moving up) while bike helmets offer more protection on the side
Jug (climbing hold) | Positive holds (can get hands behind and exert downward and outward force. Generally good holds.
Crimp (climbing hold) | Small, horizontal edge. 3 Types: Open hand crimp, half crimp, full crimp.
Sloper (climbing hold) | Negative hold, necessary to use friction and downward force in order to hold on
Pinch (climbing hold) | Active hold, necessary to use fingers and thumb to compress hold (i.e. carrying a textbook)
Undercling (climbing hold) | Orientation of a hold where it is held underneath
Gaston (climbing hold) | A kind of grip which involves pushing a hold instead of pulling (off to the side)
Side-pull (climbing hold) | Orientation of a hold where it is leveraged from one side.
Bump | Using an intermediate hold to reach for a further hold
Cross | Crossing hands across body to reach a hold
Match | Placing both hands on a single hold
Heel Hook | Leveraging/compressing on a foot hold using a heel, opening ones hips.
Toe Hook | Using ones toe to exert pressure on the far side of a hold in order to keep body tension
Bicycle | Placing both feet on either side of a hold in order to compress on it and keep body tension
Back-step | Turning hips and feet in one direction in order to stay close to the wall
Drop-knee | A drop knee where your inner-turned knee is rotated below your foot
Flag | Normal, back, front. Using one leg as a counterbalance in order to maintain body control on moves.
Barn door | Loosing balance due to incorrect technique in which the left hand/left foot or right hand/foot both lose contact with the wall simultaneously, creating a door opening motion
Lockoff | Holding one or both arms in a bent position
Deadpoint | Using momentum to reach a hold dynamically, in which the hold is located at the apex of the motion
Dyno | Using momentum to reach a hold dynamically in which all points of contact with the wall are lost momentarily
