## Philosophy
Climbing outdoors is tons of fun and very rewarding, but comes with some very different etiquette to gym climbing. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
- Leave no trace - Make sure all trash and personal items are picked up and taken with you until you find some trash receptacle. Same goes for chalk spills.
- There are no bathrooms - It's best to just go before you go, but it is also wise to see what rules are in place for when nature calls in the particular location you're in. 
- Don't blast your music - People often go to these places to enjoy the nature, and blaring music disturbs the peace. 
- Check the rules of the location - When it comes to gear, see what sort of things you can and can't do when it comes to using your gear.
- Don't overcrowd - Going with a large group of people can be tons of fun, but sometimes it can be inappropriate.
- Keep your wits about you - Climbing is dangerous, especially outside. Spot your friends, pad well, inspect your gear, check for unsafe landings... Just be smart.
