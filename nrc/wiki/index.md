Welcome to the NRC Wiki! Our goal for this portion of the site is to be the home of a wealth of information for climbing in the Boston area and beyond. We hope you find more knowledge than you could ever need about the ins and outs of climbing, working out, gear, and more. More info will be coming soon, including a comprehensive training guide, injury prevention and rehab, workouts, stretches, and more.
