## Bouldering

Shoe | Description | Velcro/Lace | Price | Pros | Cons | Comments
-----|-------------|-------------|-------|------|------|---------
La Sportiva Solution | Drastically down-turned; hooks, grabs, edges and smears on any feature you can find. | Velcro | $180 | Very popular, aggressive, solid all-around shoe for bouldering. Easy velcro | Relatively expensive, I've heard they don't last as long as you'd like | A lot of people wear these so there are probably a lot of opinions on them. I have never worn them, so ask around if you're interested.
Evolv Agro | One of the most aggressive (down-turned) shoes available | Velcro | $165 | Very downturned, great for overhanging climbing, toe/heel hooks | Painful to wear | If you wear these, you better be climbing hard
Five Ten Hiangle | Soft, down-turned, but designed for comfort. These shoes can also be used for sport climbing | Velcro | $165 | The most comfortable uncomfortable shoe out there | I've found them to not be the best for heel hooks | These are aggressive shoes but, but are still soft and comfortable. I think these are a great first pair of aggressive shoes, and I plan on using them for a long time to come.
Scarpa Instinct VS | The Instinct VS spans the performance arc from slabby boulder problems to overhanging gym routes | Velcro | $175 | More stiff than Hiangles, allowing for solid/comfortable heel/toe hooks. | A bit more insensitive than the softer options | Alex Puccio wears these, you have no excuse

## Sport

Evolv Shaman | Engineered comfort and performance with more toe rubber for toe hooking and an inset front strap for better medial side toe scumming. | Velcro | $160 | Comfortable, aggressive shoes, good for bouldering and sport. Great for all types of routes/problems | Soft rubber, less sensitive | Solid shoes; they last long, are aggressive yet comfortable, and I have only heard good things about them, although have never worn them myself.
La Sportiva Miura | A high performance lace-up climbing shoe for edging control and pocket climbing performance. | Lace | $165 | Less downturned, so great for edging on slab/less overhanging routes | More limited in terms of bouldering, severely overhanging routes | Durable and this model has been around for awhile, standing the test of time. Jack of all trades.

## Traditional

Five Ten Quantum | Comfortable, performance shoes designed by the Huber brothers (who have made difficult, big ascents all over, including on El Cap) | Lace | $185 | Excels at cracks, multi-pitch romps and, especially, steep edging. | Expensive | I own these shoes. It took me a LOT of effort to get them to fit comfortably. But now that they do, they are literally perfect fits and have allowed for amazing performance over full-day multi pitch climbs. These are also great for single pitch and sport. They are a bit specialized, but these really are great shoes if they fit you properly.
La Sportiva TC Pro | The ultimate technical, big wall, free climbing shoe developed in collaboration with La Sportiva athlete Tommy Caldwell | Lace | $185 | Ankle protection for cracks, great at both edging and crack climbing. | Specialized, best for vertical, big/long routes. Expensive | Basically the trad guru shoes

## All-Around

Shoe | Description | Velcro/Lace | Price | Pros | Cons | Comments

Five Ten Anasazi Lace-Up | Low-profile, synthetic, comfortable, and flat toe profile | Lace | $150 | Can wear them all day, great for cracks, edges, but also maintain performance on boulders/sport climbing | Bad for overhanging bouldering problems | I had these shoes and loved them, they fit perfectly and since they are synthetic maintain their shape well. Along with the Quantums, these are my favorite shoes for all-around climbing. **There are many other versions of the Anasazi's (Blanco, Guide, etc.) and they are all great, I have experience with these and they are generally considered the best all-arounders.
Five Ten Moccasym | Slipper-like, comfortable, flexible, and highly sensitive shoe | Slip on | $125 | Cheap, very comfortable, and last a long time. Great indoors and out | Not as high performance and can stretch up to a size due to there being no lining | I know people who have worn these for over a year without having to replace them, they will do you well if you're looking for cheap, comfort, and ease of use.

## Beginner

Shoe | Description | Velcro/Lace | Price | Pros | Cons | Comments
-----|-------------|-------------|-------|------|------|---------
Evolv Defy | Great value shoe, one of the top selling in the country. Sensitive, flat, and comfy. | Velcro | $89 | Comfortable all-day-long fit, breaks in fast, sensitive, good heel-hooking, great value, nice look | Loose fit, toes curl up out-of-the-box wears out fast, not best for extreme edging | A great shoe for beginners or those looking for a dedicated gym climbing shoe.
La Sportiva Tarantulace | Mostly flat, but subtly downturned shape that is comfortable, crosses over to any style of climbing, and still provides impressive performance. | Lace | $80 | Inexpensive, leather upper, comfortable fit | Not super specialized or technical | These were my first pair of shoes and they lasted me a solid year. Good starters since they are cheap and better than rentals, then you will probably want to move on.
La Sportiva Finale | Comfortable indoor and outdoor shoe, decent all around | Lace | $99 | Comfortable, sticky rubber, excellent introductory shoe. Can wear them for hours. | Not super durable, and low precision. I've also found that the orange version stains my heels orange. | These are a lot of people's first shoes, and for good reason. They're pretty great cheap all-around shoes but are certainly geared more towards beginners. 
La Sportiva Nago | An all around lace-up shoe designed for comfort and performance.  | Lace | $99 | Slightly more expensive, better version of the Tarantulace for gym/all-around climbing, focus on vertical/slab | Turn feet red, not specialized/technical | Another great beginner pair as they last a while, especially for the price.
