Welcome to our gear rental program! All NRC members have access to an assortment of climbing gear for both indoor and outdoor climbing. Currently we have:

- Carabiners
- ATCs
- Crash pads
- Personal anchors
- Quick draws
- Harnesses
- Helmets
- Ropes

Our gear rental system will work on a first-come first-serve basis; submit a request at least 24 hours in advance to make sure we can get the gear to you. We cannot guarantee that last minute requests will be fulfilled. Please only request gear that you know how to use; when it comes to certain higher-risk items like ropes, we will ask for proof that you know what you are doing. We reserve the right to deny requests at our own discretion. We have a general two-day rental limit for all gear; but, if you need to rent for a longer period let us know, and we'll reach out to you to hash out the details. Most importantly, please **do not** go climbing outdoors alone. Otherwise, just follow these steps to rent some gear:

1. Click this [Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHq9uLmrtM2oEJInpd5leDdWWqhV15xgk6NiNf3iEXzuCBIg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to be directed to our gear rental form. Once you fill it out, we'll be notified.
2. A member of the NRC E-board will reach out to you to flesh out your request and coordinate a pick-up.
3. Upon receiving the gear, you'll sign an item checkout sheet promising to not damage the gear beyond normal use and to return it on the agreed upon date.
4. Have fun!
5. Coordinate with an E-board member to return the gear.
