You don’t have to be a gym member or a club member to climb with us, just meet us at Ruggles on any of our meeting days and there will most definately be someone to guest-pass you into the gym to climb for the day (a day pass is normally ~$20, but with a guest pass it is $10 and includes rental gear/shoes for the day at Rock Spot). However, this should really only be used to dip your feet into climbing at Rock Spot, since Rock Spot members only get two guest-passes a month. If you’re going to be climbing regularly, more than twice a month or so, it’s worth it to get a membership with the club and at Rock Spot. 

Membership to NRC is only $10 for the whole year! So what are the benefits of paying the $10 club dues to join NRC?

1. Discounted membership rates at climbing gyms in the Boston Area. As a club, we primarily climb at [Rock Spot](http://southboston.rockspotclimbing.com/) where you would recieve $10 off the monthly membership for the duration of your membership with the club (Student memberships are usually $59/month, club members’ are $49/month. If you need to rent gear/shoes, it is an additional $10/month for either plan). If you want to get a membership at other climbing gyms, membership to NRC will also get you $10 off the monthly rate at [CRG Boston](https://centralrockgym.com/boston/) and a special rate at [MetroRock](https://www.metrorock.com/boston) that's almost $20 less than their student rate. 
2. Discounts on the [CollegeOutside](https://www.collegeoutside.com/) online store

If you’re interested in joining NRC, you can purchase a membership from any member of our e-board. The easiest way to do this would be to come along on one of our regular climbing days to Rock Spot or to an event. If that doesn't work for you though, you can always reach out to us one of the ways listed on the Contact page and one of our e-board members can arrange to meet with you at a time that works. If you have questions, check the FAQ page, and if you don’t see your question, head to the Contact page as well to see all the ways you can get in touch.

We look forward to climbing with you soon!
